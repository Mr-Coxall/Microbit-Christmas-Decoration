## Now let's connect the micro:bit

Let's get the micro:bit connected to the computer:
- click the "..." at the bottom left of the screen, next to the "Download" button
- select "Connect device"
- select your micro:bit ("BBC micro:bit CMSIS-DAP")
- then select "Connect"

## Now let's write your first program! @unplugged

**Now let's write your first program!**

## Now let's write your first program! @showhint

Let's program the micro:bit:
- from the code blocks, select ``||basic: Basic||``
- then click and drag out the ``||basic:show string("Hello!")||`` block.
- place it inside the ``||basic:on start||`` block
- now add you name after "Hello":
  - Example: ``||basic:show string("Hello, Jane!")||``

```blocks
// @highlight
basic.showString("Hello, Jane!")
```

## Now let's check our first program

Let's check our program:
- on the left hand side, the micro:bit simulator should have updated
- you can test run your program, to ensure it is working correctly
- if you need to fix anything, do so now

## Finally! let's flash our first program! @unplugged

**Finally! let's flash our first program!**

## Finally! let's flash our first program

Let's flash our program over to the micro:bit:
- hit the "Download" button at the bottom of the screen
- watch the lights flash on the back of the micro:bit
  - this is a good thing, it means the program is being flashed over to the micro:bit
- once it is all done, you should see your program running on the micro:bit

## Run it again

Let's run your program again:
- hit the "reset" button on the back of the micro:bit
- your program should start over again

## All done

**All Done.**
